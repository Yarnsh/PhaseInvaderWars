# Pre-jam design
Overall idea is an Advance Wars lite, Lumi as player CO, new invaders as enemy COs.
Therefore 3 levels, optimally with short VN like segments between them for a bit of character.

There will be many things in this document that are chosen for speed and ease of creation rather than quality, as this is a 3 day game jam and I am only one man.

## General Details
Screen size will be 800x600, unchangeable.
Saving, menus, options of any kind are all stretch goals. UI takes way too much time for how much it adds.

## Tactical Battle Map
- Top Priority
This is the "game" part of this game so this is top priority to create. Everything else is flavor in comparison.

### Map Itself
A grid of tiles that matches the size of the screen (to avoid coding screen scroll)
4 tile types come to mind, Plains, Forest, Mountain, Water.

Tile size should be 20x20 (ignoring overlap bits), 40x30 map size given the screen size.
Hippo engine should be updated to draw with a given depth, so we can layer the overlap of tiles and units correctly.

Plains:
- Basic tile with nothing special, basically a green square

Forest:
- 20% defense bonus in combat for unit standing on it
- Double move cost through it (for everything except infantry)
- Tile should overlap with tile above it slightly to give sense of tree height

Mountain:
- 50% defense bonus in combat for unit standing on it
- Triple move cost through it (for everything except infantry)
- Double move cost for infantry

Water:
- No units should be able to move through this
- (Stretch goal) Pleasant wave animation

Map should also have an HQ tile and a factory tile.

(Stretch goal) Capturable city tile, that provides places to heal and increases income.

HQ:
- 50% defense and default move speed
- As in Advance Wars, capturing this means victory
- (Stretch goal) capture mechanic similar to Advance Wars that uses unit health as how much you capture the building per turn, out of a total of 20
- If no capture mechanic, instant capture when you step on it would be fine.

Factory:
- 30% defense and default move speed
- Place to spawn new units
- (Stretch goal) if we have capturable cities, making the factories capturable would be good too, otherwise having to bring units to occupy them is more interesting.

(Stretch goal) City:
- 30% defense and default move speed
- Capturable
- If you own it, it will increase your funds per turn by $1000

All tiles that can be fought on should have a background for the combat animation, 400x600 to take up half the screen.

### Units
The pawns whos lives you will be throwing away.

3 basic units per army, Infantry, Tank, Anti-tank. Simple rock-paper-scissors dynamic. The 3 units for each army should be visually different, but mechanically the same.

Infantry:
- Damage dealing
  - 55% vs Infantry
  - 10% vs Tank
  - 85% vs Anti-Tank
- 3 movement
- $1000

Tank:
- Damage dealing
  - 80% vs Infantry
  - 55% vs Tank
  - 40% vs Anti-Tank
- 6 movement
- $7000

Anti-tank:
- Damage dealing
  - 15% vs Infantry
  - 90% vs Tank
  - 30% vs Anti-Tank
- 3 movement
- $3000

Health of all units will be stored as a float, max 10. This value rounded up to the nearest int will be the displayed unit strength.

(Stretch goal) A special unit for each army

Lumi:
- Jet plane, expensive and ignores movement costs of terrain, can go over water
Jelly:
- Very tanky jellyfish alien thing, moderate damage output to all, slow
Dizzy:
- No god damn idea
Ember:
- Flamer thrower infantry, cheap-ish and very very strong against infantry and anti-tank, useless against tanks

### Interactivity

Mode 1: Cursor

- Have a cursor that you can move around to select different tiles on the map.
- `select` and `cancel` actions, basically A and B on controller or Z and X on keyboard probably.
- Arrows or d-pad to move the cursor around.
- Cursor should have a slightly different sprite when it is over something selectable (owned unit or factory)
- Cursor movement should be instant as soon as you press a direction
- Holding direction should move the cursor every 0.2 seconds
If selecting an empty tile, or one with an enemy unit/building on it, switch to mode 3 (menu), options:
  - End Turn
  - Cancel
(Stretch goal) If selecting an enemy unit:
- Switch to an undesigned mode, where the move+1 range of the unit is displayed as red overlay, to show attack range
If selecting tile with a player controlled unit that has more than 0 `action_points`:
- Switch to mode 2 (unit control)
If selecting tile with player controlled factory:
- Switch to mode 3 (menu), options:
  - One option per unit type, showing unit name and cost, gray out if not enough funds
  - (stretch goal) special unit, with its cost, grayed out if cant afford
  - Cancel

---

Mode 2: Unit Control

A single player controlled unit will be selected when in this mode. Cursor will still be visible in this mode.

The `cancel` action should bring you back to Mode 1

Each unit will have an `action_points` value of 2 at the beginning of a turn.

If `action_points` == 2:
- Draw a blue overlay on every tile reachable by this unit this turn, calculated from its movement points against the terrain around us
- Terrain needs a dikstras like algorythm to find reachable tiles and lowest cost path to them, basically running pathfinding to nothing from the unit
- The `select` action on any blue tile will cause the unit to move there and reduce `action_points` to 1
- There should be an animation of the unit moving to the new location, during which the player will have no control
- A red overlay should be drawn on any non-blue tile adjacent to a blue tile, to show theoretical attack range
- If `action` is pressed on the unit again, move to the `action_points` == 1 case without actually changing the value
If `action_points` == 1:
- Draw a red overlay on tiles adjacent to selected unit
- If `select` is pressed on a red tile that has an enemy unit on it, initiate combat with that unit and reduce `action_points` to zero
If `action_points` == 0:
- Return to Mode 1

---

Mode 3: Menu

A simple rectangular menu with a vertical list of options should appear centered on the screen. There should be a cursor showing the currently hovered item.
Pressing `select` will do a custom action depending on the selected option, pressing `cancel` should bring you back to Mode 1.

Possible options:
- "Cancel", should bring you back to Mode 1
- "End Turn", end the player turn and let the AI do theirs
- Unit listing, if greyed out should do nothing, otherwise spawn a new unit with 0 `action_points` of the selected type on the selected tile, reduce funds by unit cost.

### Enemy AI
This section is very TODO. General idea should be to have an evaluation function, and test the map state after every possible move of a single unit,
 then do the best rated move.
Repeat this for every unit the AI controls.

Next, for every unoccupied factory the AI controls look at the next entry in a predefined "build order" for this level. If there are enough funds spawn that unit and
 increment the build order idx. The build order should also have a predefined "loop idx", if the idx goes past the end we loop to that point and not the start.

General ideas for evaluation function:
- Basic material advantage, fund cost of your active units vs theirs
- Distance to enemy HQ (closer is better)
- Distance of enemy to our HQ (closer is worse)
- Friendly units on a more defensive tile will improve evaluation
- Friends being within attack range of an enemy unit is bad (scaled on max amount of damage they could do some unit in range)

Testing this for effectiveness would take forever, so as long as it looks even remotely non-stupid, accept it.

During an enemy turn movement and battle animations should play, but the cursor and tile overlays and such have no reason to be shown.
